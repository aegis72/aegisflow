AegisFlow XL and AegisFlow 1.5 are ComfyUI workflows designed by a professional for professionals.

Hi! This is my personal workflow that I created for ComfyUI to enable me to use generative AI tools on my own art and on my job as a working artist. 
Hopefully, it can help you too.

This isn’t intended to be “the workflow to end all workflows.” It isn’t intended to perform endless inpainting, etc. It may grow to that, but for now, I had simple goals for this tool:

+ To reimagine my previous work
+ To test ideas quickly without having to fully render new images
+ To generate multiple related assets in a ”project” style workflow, and then automatically name and associate them with each other in a project folder.

This workflow is Donationware. I think folks should be compensated for art, but I also agree that art should be for everyone. This workflow is completely dependent on the hard work of others making art generative AI work, whom I believe you should support as well in whatever method you are able. 

Distribute this workflow as you wish, and if you find it useful, support the folks that make your life easier and more creative. That includes continuing to expand your own technique... AI should be a tool, not a replacement for your own point of view, artistic vision or message.

If you don’t want to deal with the intricacies of setting everything up, downloading checkpoints, etc, I do sell a portable installation of this workflow  and all the software pre-installed on a 256gb flash drive for $60 shipped. It will run on any Windows machine capable of running Stable Diffusion. That price covers my time, shipping and the cost of the drive---the software remains governed by the licenses of each individual component of the workflow. im also working on a Linux compatible version.
